	<h3>Language</h3>
	<p>Japan's official language is Japanese, but English is generally understood in major cities 
	and designated tourist sites.<p>
<br>
	<h3>Timezone</h3>
	<p>All of Japan sits within the same time zone, and no daylight saving is practiced. The country 
	is nine hours ahead of GMT.</p>
<br>
	<h3>Wifi & Connectivity</h3>
	<p>Wireless hotspots are popping up all over major cities in Japan, so you should never be too
	far from a Wi-Fi connection.</p>
<br>
	<h3>Currency</h3>
	<p>The Japanese yen is used throughout the country and you can exchange foreign currency at the 
	airports and most major banks.</p>
<br>
	<h3>Tipping</h3>
	<p>Tipping is not practiced in Japan. In fact, it can cause discomfort and confusion if you do. A service
	charge is generally added on to the final bill in restaurants.</p>
<br>
	<h3>Staying Safe</h3>
	<p>If you do find yourself in a situation that requires serious help, dial 110 for an urgent call 
	to the police and 119 for fire or ambulance.</p>
<br>
	<h3>Custom & Manners</h3>
	<p>Following a general travelers code of respect for the people you meet and places you visit will 
	stand you in good stead.</p>
